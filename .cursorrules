The tech stack is Fastify, Socket.IO, and PixiJS.

We are making an exact clone of diep.io.

We are using the following libraries:
- PixiJS for rendering
- Socket.IO for networking
- Fastify for the server

client should handle input, rendering and networking.

server should handle the game logic and state.

File names should be in kebab-case.

diep.io game design:
Player can move around the map.
Player can shoot projectiles.
Projectiles can collide with other players and walls.
Players can die and respawn after a short delay.
