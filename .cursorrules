The tech stack is Fastify, Socket.IO, and PixiJS.

We are making an exact clone of diep.io.

We are using the following libraries:
- PixiJS for rendering
- Socket.IO for networking
- Fastify for the server

client should handle input, rendering and networking.

server should handle the game logic and state.
